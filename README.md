## Description
This project provides a well-structured framework for automating API testing using Java, TestNG, and RestAssured. It allows you to efficiently test various aspects of RESTful APIs through a series of pre-defined test cases.<br>
Executes various HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) to interact with APIs and verify their behavior.<br>
1. Get all users (Positive Case)
2. Get single user (Positive Case)
3. Get single user not found (Negative Case)
4. Create new user (Positive Case)
5. Update user (Positive Case)
6. Patch user (Positive Case)
7. Delete user (Positive Case)

## Expected Output
The script will execute all test cases defined in the apiAuto4.java class. If tests pass, you'll see success messages. If there are failures, detailed information about the error will be displayed. Additionally, request and response logs will be printed to the console, providing valuable debugging insights.

## Running Test
1. git clone https://github.com/jefprisimont/apiAuto4.git
1. open src/test/java/apiAuto4
2. Run "public class apiAuto4"
